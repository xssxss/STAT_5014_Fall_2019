## Today's Agenda

- Review the concepts of Reproducible Research  
- Review Git  
- Importing, cleaning and munging data
- Summarizing and exploring data
- Vectors, matrices, and data frames 
- Homework 3


## Thoughts/issues from last time/homework

Homework  
    -Swirl -- thoughts?  
    -Git -- ok?  
    -R -- any problems? Knitr and LaTeX?  

## Reproducible Research | Review

This was the scenario:  
You had worked 6 months to analyze a data set.  Someone else analyzes the data and comes to *different* conclusions.  How good are your notes???

Answer: **_Awesome, because you annotated your code with text to create a RR compendium_**

## Reproducible Research - Concepts
**_Basically just switching the role of code and comments in writing software_**

Guide to this topic here: 
<http://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/>

In general, we should **weave** code and text into a complete reference of our work.  The document should:

- download or otherwise load/generate data
- reproduce steps to munge data
- recreate analysis steps
- create figures and tables
- explain any and all steps along the way
- end with conclusions drawn
- optionally add suggestions for future experiments  

## Version Control  

What is version control - a system for storing data and tracking changes.   

- Why should I use version control?
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1408450/why-should-i-use-version-control>
- R and version control for the solo data analyst  
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2712421/r-and-version-control-for-the-solo-data-analyst>

Thoughts or comments??

## Version Control and Git

Git is essentially a database of snapshots of the project directory tree.  You decide when and what to take snapshots of and if you using GitHub (or similar) when to push a copy to a remote repository.

The basic workflow is:  

1. git **pull**  
2. **do work**  
3. git **pull** to make sure you have latest files
4. git **add** *\<your changed file\>* tells git what change you care about  
5. git **commit** -m "some INFORMATIVE message about the changes"  
6. git **push** to the repository (local or remote)  
7. repeat  

## Git file states

- Untracked - files that have not been added to the database
- Committed - data is safely stored in your local database  
- Modified - file is changed but not committed it to your database yet  
- Staged - a modified file in its current version will go in next commit snapshot

## Back to Reproducible Research Analysis

From Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund's R for Data Science 
<http://r4ds.had.co.nz>  
![Data Science Pipeline](./img/data-science-pipeline.png)  

Today we focus on getting and cleaning the data.

## Data wrangling

Data wrangling or munging is the process of going from raw to useful data.  This can be 60-80% of the time spent on a project.  Steps may include any or all of the following:

+----------+-------------------------+
| Step     | Examples                |
+==========+=========================+
| Import   | - read.table(html,json) |
+----------+-------------------------+
| Clean    | - filter and subset     |
|          | - standardize           |
|          | - renaming              |
|          | - type conversions      |
+----------+-------------------------+
| Reformat | - merging               |
|          | - reshaping             |
|          | - aggregating           |
+----------+-------------------------+


## Data wrangling -- getting data 

- load internal dataset 
```{r echo=T, eval=F}
    library(help = "datasets")
    ?PlantGrowth
```
- copy and paste  
- load file  
    + local  
    + web  
```{r echo=T, eval=F}
    ?read.table; ?read.csv
    url<-"http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/wuhamadabook/data/onewaymuzzle.dat"
    chp2_muzzle<-read.table(url,header=T)
    #google "how to get data into R"
```
- generate data
```{r echo=T, eval=F}
    set.seed(123456)
    coin_flips<-rbinom(n = 1000,size = 1, prob = .501)
```

## Data importing -- good practices

If you are getting data from the internet, it is a good idea to protect against:

1. data source being down  
2. data source being changed  
3. other unknown issues  

I generally pull the data down, then save the data to an .Rds file.  My project includes:  

1. commented code used to pull data down  
2. commented code used to save data  
3. code to read data into R from the saved file  
4. AND often project image files as mid-stream checkpoints


## Data wrangling - cleaning  

Getting data into R is *__usually__* not the problem, often the fun starts when we start to actually look at what we were given.  Common issues:  

issue | examples
:-----|:-------
missing values | recorded as "-", "NA","0"
jagged arrays | missing fields  
inconsistent data coding | 2017-01-22 vs 01-22-2017 vs Jan 22, 2017
line termination | platform inconsistencies
field delimiter issues | csv has data values that use commas  
  

And pretty much any other issue you might imagine.

## Data wrangling - summarizing and tables

A quick way to see if there are issues with the data is to create a summary of the data. There are many useful metrics to capture, BUT, at a high level, here we really are most concerned with metrics associated with the data structure, i.e. number of observations, missing values, data types etc.  R has a function for that...  :)  

```{r echo=T,eval=F}
    ?str
    ?summary
    str(iris)
    summary(iris)
```


## Data wrangling - reformatting/standardizing

Now that we have the data in R, we need to get it into a useable format.  One idea for a set of standards for structuring a data set is to create a so called "tidy" data set.

<http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html>

Essentially, we need to reformat the data such that:  

1. Each variable forms a column.  
2. Each observation forms a row.  
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.  

Any other structure to the data is considered messy.  Sound easy?  

## Data wrangling - reformatting 

OK, what is wrong with this? 
```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
    messy_data1_df<-data.frame(treatmenta=c("NA",16,3),treatmentb=c(2,11,1),row.names=c("John Smith","Jane Doe","Mary Johnson"),stringsAsFactors=F)
    knitr::kable(messy_data1_df,format = "markdown", caption="Messy Data")
```
  
What we want is something more akin to a model:  

$$
y_i = \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} ...
$$

*Going to give this topic more time next week with the tidyverse*

To print the table in a document, we have several options.  My current favorites are kable and stargazer.  Other community tools include **Pander** and **xtable**.

## Data wrangling -- other wrangling tasks

dplyr is another package by Hadley Wickam.  As a practicing data scientist, he has a good feel for what functions we would like to see.

A few data processing goals enabled in dplyr

1. data summarizing  
2. subsetting by observation  
3. subsetting variables  
4. creating new variables  
5. grouping data  
6. combining data  

*look at Data Wrangling Cheatsheet*

## Data wrangling -- quick plot summaries

Sometimes, a picture really is worth a 1000 words.

```{r boxexample, echo=F, include=T, eval=T, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
    library(beeswarm)
    sex <- (runif(1000)>0.5)*1
    drug_duration <- sex*0.1 + rnorm(1000, 0, 0.1) + 5
    drug_info <- data.frame(cbind(drug_duration,sex))
    drug_info$id <- ifelse(drug_info$sex==0,"M","F")
    par(mfcol=c(1,2))
    boxplot(drug_info$drug_duration)
    beeswarm(drug_duration,add=T, pch=20, cex=0.3)
    boxplot(drug_duration~id,drug_info)
    beeswarm(drug_duration~id,drug_info, add=T, pch=20, cex=0.3)
```

## Data wrangling -- another quick plot

```{r lcng_implementation, echo=F,eval=T,results='asis', fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
    library(scatterplot3d)
    new_lcng_number<-function(last,current_mult,
                              current_increment,current_modulus){
        temp<-(current_mult*last+current_increment) %% current_modulus
        return(temp)
    }

    par(mfcol=c(1,2),mai=c(0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1))
    a<-1.9;c<-1;m<-3;x2_0<-5  ## with a pattern in 3D
    t_obsevs=3*1000+2
    lcng2a<-data.frame(matrix(x2_0,nrow=t_obsevs,ncol=2))
    for(i in 3:t_obsevs){
        lcng2a[i,1]<-new_lcng_number(lcng2a[i-1,1],a,c,m)
        lcng2a[i,2]<-i%%3
    }
    lcng2a<-lcng2a[-c(1:2),]
    scatterplot3d(x=lcng2a[lcng2a$X2==0,1],y=lcng2a[lcng2a$X2==1,1],z=lcng2a[lcng2a$X2==2,1],pch=20,axis = F)
    a<-11.9;c<-1;m<-3;x2_0<-5 ## no OBVIOUS pattern in 3D
    t_obsevs=3*1000+2
    lcng2a<-data.frame(matrix(x2_0,nrow=t_obsevs,ncol=2))
    for(i in 3:t_obsevs){
        lcng2a[i,1]<-new_lcng_number(lcng2a[i-1,1],a,c,m)
        lcng2a[i,2]<-i%%3
    }
    lcng2a<-lcng2a[-c(1:2),]
    scatterplot3d(x=lcng2a[lcng2a$X2==0,1],y=lcng2a[lcng2a$X2==1,1],z=lcng2a[lcng2a$X2==2,1],pch=20, axis=F)
    

```

## Data wranging -- common plots

1. histogram
2. box plot vs violin plot
3. scatter plot
4. pie chart, ...

*don't forget color and shape as dimensions*

## Remember -- Good practices note

If you are getting data from the internet, it is a good idea to protect against:

1. data source being down  
2. data source being changed  
3. other unknown issues  

I generally pull the data down, then save the data to a .Rds file.  My project includes:  

1. commented code used to pull data down  
2. commented code used to save data  
3. code to read data into R from the saved file  
4. AND often project image files as mid-stream checkpoints

## Basic R data structures

- vector
- matrices (and arrays)
- data frame
- list

## Vectors

Vectors are data structures containing 1 or more elements of the same type.  R knows about **logical, numeric (integer and double), character**, complex and raw.  For instance:

```{r eval=F, include=T, echo=T}
v<-1  
v<-c(1,2)  
v<-c("a","b")
```

Note 1: a scalar is a vector  
Note 2: v<-c("a",1) may not do what you want.  

try: typeof(v), str(v), or class(v)  

## Matrices

Matrices are the two dimensional version of vectors.  All elements are of the same type.  Arrays are the multi-dimensional equivalent to matrices, but are actually vectors.

```{r eval=F, include=T, echo=T}
y<-matrix(LETTERS,nrow = 13)
rnames<-c(1:13)
cnames<-c("odds","evens")
y<-matrix(LETTERS,nrow = 13,byrow = T, dimnames=list(rnames,cnames))
z<-array(1:12,c(3,2,2))
str(z)
```

## Data Frames (and data tables)

Data frames are generic matrices meaning they can hold data of different types (by column).

```{r eval=F, include=T, echo=T}
# ?data.frame
L3 <- LETTERS[1:3]
fac <- sample(L3, 10, replace = TRUE)
(d <- data.frame(x = 1, y = 1:10, fac = fac))
```

## Lists | we won't use this for a while

An unordered collection of objects.  These can be useful in creating complex data types.

```{r eval=F, include=T, echo=T}
name<-c("jack","jill","joe","jenny")
ages<-c(6,7,8,9)
people<-list(name=name,ages=ages)
people<-list()
people[["jack"]]<-data.frame(age=6,married="T",spouse="jill")
people[["jill"]]<-data.frame(age=6,married="T",spouse="jack")
people[["joe"]]<-data.frame(age=6,married="F")
```

## Examples | simple calculations

1. calculate sum of 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 400^2
2. calculate sum of 1\*2 + 2\*3 + 3\*4 + ... + 249\*250

## Example | Numerical integration using Riemann sum

$\int_0^{\pi/6}cos(x) dx$

```{r echo=F, eval=T, include=T, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}

par(mfcol=c(1,2))
##example 1 -- f(x) = x^2

# step 1: partition the range of the integration into n segements.
n.seg = 6  # this is the total number of segments. 
segments = seq(from = 1, to = 3, length.out = n.seg + 1)
# this gives n.seg+1 equally spaced segment points
plot(segments, segments^2,type='n', main='x^2', col="red", xlim=c(1,3),xaxs="i")
# step 2. calculate the evaluation point, middle point of each segment.
eval.points = (segments[1:n.seg] + segments[2:(n.seg+1)])/2
# step 3. calculate the width of the segments.
del = (2)/n.seg
rect(eval.points-del/2,0,eval.points+del/2,ytop=eval.points^2,xpd=F,col="green")
lines(eval.points, (eval.points)^2, col="red",type="l")
# step 4. evaluate the function at the evaluation points
f.t = cos(eval.points) 
# step 5. calculate the area of each rectangle and sum up.
total1<-sum(f.t*del)


##example 2 -- f(x) = cos(x)

# step 1: partition the range of the integration into n segements.
n.seg = 1000  # this is the total number of segments. 
segments = seq(from = 0, to = pi/6, length.out = n.seg + 1)
# this gives n.seg+1 equally spaced segment points
plot(segments, cos(segments), type='l', main='cos(x)')
# step 2. calculate the evaluation point, middle point of each segment.
eval.points = (segments[1:n.seg] + segments[2:(n.seg+1)])/2
# step 3. calculate the width of the segments.
del = (pi/6)/n.seg
# step 4. evaluate the function at the evaluation points
f.t = cos(eval.points) 
# step 5. calculate the area of each rectangle and sum up.
total2<-sum(f.t*del)

```

## Example | Solve system of equations

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_1 - 2x_2 &= -1  \\
-x_1 + 3x_2 &= 3
\end{aligned}
$$
Can be written:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 \\ -1 & 3 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 3\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$
OR, solving:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 \\ -1 & 3 \end{pmatrix}^{-1}
\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 3\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$
