## Today's Agenda

- Review data munging and creating tidy datasets
- Introduce good programming practices  
- R functions  
- for next  
- if else 
- while loop  

## Data wrangling - messy data symptoms

- Column headers are values, not variable names.
- Multiple variables are stored in one column.
- Variables are stored in both rows and columns.
- Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.  
- A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

With a goal of eventually evaluating a model:  
$$
y_i = \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} ...
$$

## Quick import, munge and tidy example (will go through)  

```{r Problem5_LongJump_analysis, echo=T, eval=F, include=T, tidy=F, tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 60)}
    ###########################  
    #Problem5_LongJump_analysis  
    #get data  
    ###########################  
    ## note that libraries were loaded in the setup chunk 
    url<-"http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/wuhamadabook/data/LongJumpData.dat"
    LongJump_raw<-read.table(url, header=F, skip=1, fill=T, stringsAsFactors = F)
    colnames(LongJump_raw)<-rep(c("V1","V2"),4)
    LongJump_tidy<-rbind(LongJump_raw[,1:2],LongJump_raw[,3:4],
                             LongJump_raw[,5:6],LongJump_raw[,7:8])
    LongJump_tidy<-LongJump_tidy %>%  
        filter(!(is.na(V1))) %>%
        mutate(YearCode=V1, Year=V1+1900, dist=V2) %>%
        select(-V1,-V2)
    
    ########################### 
    
```

## More challenging import, munge and tidy example (will go through)   

```{r Problem5_Tomato_analysis, echo=T, eval=F, include=T, tidy=F, tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 60)}
    ###########################

    Tomato_raw<-read.table(url, header=F, skip=2, fill=T, stringsAsFactors = F, comment.char = "")
    Tomato_tidy<-Tomato_raw %>%  
        separate(V2,into=paste("C10000",1:3,sep="_"),sep=",",remove=T, extra="merge") %>%

## Good Programming Practices

Most analysis will require some amount of programming (scripting).  As we program, we should strive to create readable and reusable code.  The art of creating good code is captured in the broad and opinionated topic of Good Programming Practices.  You will devolop your own style, but it would be good to start with some guidance from some experts.  

Google's R Style Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml>  
Hadley Wickam's Style Guide: <http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html>  

## Good Programming Practices cont

Remember: ultimate goal is Reproducible Research.  
To enable this, we need well documented (annotated) _**readable**_ code.

1. variable/object names  
    + nouns describing what the object holds, e.g. originaData instead of d  
    + DO NOT use existing variables or functions, e.g. T<-1000
2. function formation  
    + function names should be verb associated with the function purpose  
    + comment both function purpose and required arguments    
    + arguments should have defaults (my personal preference)
    + my preference is to explicitly return a value  
3. commenting rules  
    + comment your code!!  'nough said?  
4. indent within logical blocks of code !!
    + indenting improves the readability of the code by orders of magnitude!  
    
## Functions

A function is an _**object**_ that takes some input objects (args) and produces some output objects.  _**All**_ work in R is done in functions. '[<-'(animals,4,"duck")

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
    dataA<-1;dataB<-2

    BAD<-function(x){
    mean(c(x,dataA))
    }
    
    computeMeanGOOD<-function(x=3,y=5){
        # quick function to compute the geometric mean of two numbers, x and y
        # returns geometric mean
        if (!is.numeric(x) || !is.numeric(y)) stop("both x and y must be numeric")
        return((x+y)/2)
    }
    
    BAD(x=dataB)
    computeMeanGOOD(x=dataA,y=dataB)
```

GOOD functions include passing in ALL necessary data.  If we do not do this, we can have MAJOR issues with variable scope that is often difficult to troubleshoot.  Ideally our code also includes error checking.

## Variable scope

R uses Lexical scoping rules.  What tha?

<https://darrenjw.wordpress.com/2011/11/23/lexical-scope-and-function-closures-in-r/>  
Totally recommend subscribing to Darren's blog AND reading all his past posts.  

<http://andrewgelman.com/2014/01/29/stupid-r-tricks-random-scope/>  
Another good site.  Also has a few great stats books.

While we are at it, r-bloggers has many useful tidbits. <https://www.r-bloggers.com>

```{r eval=F, echo=T}
    z <- 1; a <- 1
    m <- function(){a <- 2; return(c(a,z)) }
    m(); a
    
    a <- 1; b <- 2
    f<-function(x){ a*x + b }
    ## what about this one??
    g<-function(x){ a <<- 2; b <- 1; print(objects()); f(x) }
    g(2)

```


## FOR statement

Often, we want to loop through a set number of items or do a task a predetermined length of time.  Can add additional controls via **break** and **next**.  To get help on functions type ?"for"

```{r echo=T, eval=T, cache=T}
    Iter <- 5
    cumIndex <- 0
    for(i in 1:Iter){
        #if(i %% 2==1) next
        cumIndex <- cumIndex + 1
        #if(cumIndex>3) break
    }
    print(cumIndex)

```

## If ELSE statement

A powerful addition to any program is the ability to change the course of the program as conditions change.  In R, one such flow change statement is the if else statement.

```{r eval=T, echo=T}
    Iter <- 20
    cumSumODDS <- 0
    cumSumEVENS <- 0
    for(i in 1:Iter){
        if(i %% 2 == 1){
            print(paste0("i=",i," is odd"))
            cumSumODDS = cumSumODDS + i
        }else{
            print(paste0("i=",i," is even"))
            cumSumEVENS = cumSumEVENS + i
        }
    }
    cumSumEVENS
    cumSumODDS
```

## While loop

A while loop can be thought of as a combination of a for loop and an if statement.  Do until condition is true.  In any iterative function, it is a good idea to a) have a progress indicator and b) have a fail safe.

```{r eval=T, echo=T}
    dummyVar <- 0
    iter <- 0
    while(dummyVar<100){
        dummyVar = dummyVar + 1
        ## PROGRESS
        if(dummyVar %% 5 == 0){
            print(paste0("loop step=",dummyVar))
        }
        ## FAIL SAFE
        if(iter>50){
            break
        }else{
            iter=iter+1
        }
    }
```

## Timing

As you start to make functions, it is a good idea to think about how long things take.

Really good blog on this here:  <https://www.r-bloggers.com/5-ways-to-measure-running-time-of-r-code/>

Consider the following code and timings:

```{r echo=T, eval=T, cache=F,tidy=F}
    library("microbenchmark")
    ##takes a vector and a value, determines if the elements of the vector are to the right/left
    left_right1<-function(x = c(0.1,0.9), bar = 0.5){
        temp<-NULL
        for(i in seq_along(x)){
            temp[i] <- (x[i]>bar)*1
        }
        return(temp)
    }
    left_right2 <- function(x = c(0.1,0.9), bar = 0.5){
        ifelse(x>bar,1,0)
    }
    x1<-rnorm(n = 50000,mean=0.5)
    times<-microbenchmark(result1<-left_right1(x=x1),result2<-left_right2(x=x1),times = 100, unit = "ms",control=list(warmup=0))
```    

## Timings plot

```{r echo=F, eval=T, cache=F, fig.height=3}
    #identical(result1, result2)
    ggplot2::autoplot(times)
```

## Bit more on functions in R 

<https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/programming.html>

Everything in R is essentially a function call.  Generally, this means at some point the function call will make a call to the underlying C/Fortran code.

"A golden rule in R programming is to access the underlying C/Fortran routines as quickly as possible; the fewer functions calls required to achieve this, the better. For example, suppose `x` is a standard vector of length `n`. Then:"

## Example
```{r, eval=F}
x = x + 1
```
*has a single call to the `+`* function, whereas:

```{r, eval=F}
for(i in seq_len(n)) 
  x[i] = x[i] + 1
```

has:  

- *n* function calls to *+*;  
- *n* function calls to the *[* function;  
- *n* function calls to the *[<-*   function;  
- one call to the *for* function;  
- one call the the *seq_along* function.

We will check this out in a bit.

## Memory allocation -- Method 1

Memory management is the Achilles' heel of many programming languages.  If we are careful in our programming, we can alleviate many of the issues.

Consider the following examples given in Gillespie's R Book:

Method 1: create empty vector, grow vector to final size

```{r echo=T, eval=T, include=T}

method1 = function(n) {
  vec = NULL # Or vec = c()
  for(i in seq_len(n))
    vec = c(vec, i)
  vec
}
```

## Memory allocation -- Method 2

Method 2: create vector of final length and change values via subscripting

```{r echo=T, eval=T, include=T}
method2 = function(n) {
  vec = numeric(n)
  for(i in seq_len(n))
    vec[i] = i
  vec
}
```

## Memory allocation -- Method 3

Method 3: create final object directly

```{r echo=T, eval=T, include=T}
method3 = function(n) seq_len(n)
```

Thoughts on the 3 methods??

## Memory and functions

This topic is really intertwined with lexical scoping.  The basic idea is that R manages objects by creating environments.  Each environment is essentially a bag of names pointing to thier associated memory space.  Creating a function, creates a new environment.  The environment lives as long as the function is active.

<http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html#lexical-scoping>  
<http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Environments.html>

As you program in R more, you will want to pay special attention to memory management and function calls.

-- memory used  
-- speed issues  

look at memory size of objects
look at memory use of R
look at memory use of R during a function call with large object
